## Know more about this project
Please visit [post](https://willyii.github.io/posts/2018-08-07-AlphaGo-Zero.html) for the theory detail

## Note 
1. Due to the hardware limitation, the board size only 8 * 8. I just wanna make sure this idea can runs well.
2. Since the Neural Network is large, if you do not have GPU in your machine, it might take up to 30 second to take one action.
